// This is the main theme definition, with properties common to and overridable
// from all sub-themes. (It has to be a separate file so it can be included as-is
// in subtheme rules, as a mixin would perform early variable evaluation.)

// These theme variables are only accessible from within special blocks in your
// LESS rules, as follows:
//
// div.myclass {
//   height: 40px;
//   .themed({
//     color: @themeEmphasisTextColor;
//   });
// }
//
// Such blocks will be spliced in and the styles overridden at runtime depending
// on any override class (see theme-overrides.less) applied to the <html> tag.
